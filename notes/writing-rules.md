# Writing Rules for Nexotype Content

## Core Principle
Write like a human, not an AI. Avoid patterns that scream "this was written by an LLM."

## Specific Rules

### 1. NO Em-Dashes (-)
❌ **Don't use**: "Tongkat Ali works through two pathways - it reduces SHBG"
✅ **Use instead**: "Tongkat Ali works through two pathways: it reduces SHBG" (colon)
✅ **Or**: "Tongkat Ali works through two pathways. It reduces SHBG" (period)

### 2. Natural Sentence Flow
- Use colons (:) for explanations
- Use periods (.) to separate complete thoughts
- Use commas and "which/that" for descriptive clauses
- Vary sentence structures to avoid AI-like patterns

### 3. Human Writing Patterns
- Don't over-explain everything
- Use natural transitions
- Avoid robotic formatting
- Write conversationally but professionally

## Examples of Better Alternatives

**Instead of AI-style dashes:**
- "This supplement - unlike others" → "This supplement, unlike others"
- "Benefits include - increased energy" → "Benefits include increased energy" 
- "Research shows - significant improvements" → "Research shows significant improvements"

**Use varied sentence connectors:**
- Colons for lists/explanations
- "which" and "that" for descriptions  
- "but" and "however" for contrasts
- Natural conjunctions like "and," "so," "because"

## Remember
The goal is content that reads naturally, as if written by a knowledgeable human expert, not an AI assistant.
