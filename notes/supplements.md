Below is a list of dietary supplements that Stanford Professor [Andrew Huberman](https://fastlifehacks.com/category/andrew-huberman/) uses and/or discusses, along with supplement dosage.

Huberman combines the Tongkat and Fadogia supplements, but they can also be taken separately.

- [Zinc](https://fastlifehacks.com/andrew-huberman-supplements-list/#Zinc) – important for maintaining healthy testosterone levels
- [Boron](https://fastlifehacks.com/andrew-huberman-supplements-list/#Boron) – 2 – 4 mg per day

**Huberman Supplements for Improving Sleep Quality:**

- [Magnesium L-Threonate](https://fastlifehacks.com/andrew-huberman-supplements-list/#Magnesium_L-Threonate) – 140 mg

Huberman takes all 4 sleep supplements together around 60 minutes before bed.

Occasionally when Huberman has difficulty sleeping, he adds these two supplements:

- [GABA](https://fastlifehacks.com/andrew-huberman-supplements-list/#GABA_Glycine) – 100 mg

## **Supplements I’ll Add In As I Age**

### **Age 45: NAC 1 gram**

**_____**

**Here are 8 of my favorite nootropics:**

1. **Magnesium L-threonate.** Magnesium comes in many pill forms, but I like L-threonate because it’s easily absorbable and targets your brain. Magnesium L-threonate is what I’d call a “normal” supplement — very popular, easy to take. L-threonate is currently in [clinical trials](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02210286?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block) to determine whether it can be used as a learning aid for people with dementia. I take magnesium L-threonate daily.
2. **Alpha-GPC.** In the U.S., Alpha-GPC is only available as a dietary supplement, but some European countries prescribe it medically. Its aim is to increase acetylcholine, a naturally occurring brain chemical central to learning and memory functions.
3. **Lion’s Mane Mushrooms.** Well-known to mycologists (people who study mushrooms), Lion’s Mane is full of essential nutrients, including complex carbs, vitamins, and minerals. Scientific studies of the mushroom have shown it to [heal neural pathways](https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/15/9/15073/htm?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block) and [protect against long-term learning and memory slowdowns](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/biomedres/32/1/32_1_67/_article/-char/ja/?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block).
4. **Methylfolate.** Methylfolate is a [medically recommended](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-162998/l-methylfolate-oral/details?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block) B-vitamin supplement. It contains folic acid, which is essential to the body’s production of healthy cells. It’s particularly beneficial for people who are naturally deficient in folate — either for genetic or lifestyle reasons.
5. **Ashwagandha.** Ashwagandha is an herb, and a longtime staple of Ayurveda medicine. Studies have linked it to [a number of health benefits](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/ashwagandha#1.-May-help-reduce-stress-and-anxiety?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block), including better sleep, lower stress, and increased testosterone. Unlike straight-up testosterone supplements, ashwagandha helps the body naturally produce more testosterone, a healthier approach.
6. **L-tyrosine.** Another chemical naturally produced by the body; tyrosine is an amino acid central to mental focus. I use it for sharper thinking, but people use it for a range of purposes, including breaking addictions to alcohol and cocaine.

_____

Some adaptogens are thought to help boost testosterone levels. Here are a few commonly mentioned:

1.	Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera): This herb is one of the most researched when it comes to raising testosterone levels. Studies have shown that ashwagandha may enhance testosterone levels and significantly improve sperm quality and fertility in men.

2.	Rhodiola Rosea: Known for its ability to enhance energy and reduce fatigue, Rhodiola is sometimes linked with improved sexual function and increased testosterone levels, although research is less conclusive than for Ashwagandha.

3.	Tongkat Ali (Eurycoma longifolia): Often used to improve sexual function, Tongkat Ali also appears to have potential for increasing male testosterone levels. Studies suggest that it can improve the testosterone status of individuals with low levels.

4.	Shilajit: A tar-like substance used in Ayurveda, shilajit has been studied for its potential to increase testosterone levels in healthy men and those with low testosterone.
