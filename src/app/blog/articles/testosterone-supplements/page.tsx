        <SimpleSection title="The Modern Testosterone Crisis">
          <Text>
            Modern men's testosterone levels have dropped by 20-30% over the past three decades. 
            Environmental toxins, chronic stress, poor sleep, and sedentary lifestyles all contribute 
            to this hormonal decline that affects energy, muscle mass, mood, and overall vitality.
          </Text>

          <Text>
            While synthetic hormone replacement therapy exists, natural supplementation offers a safer, 
            more sustainable approach to optimizing testosterone production. The key is targeting 
            different biological pathways that support your body's natural hormone manufacturing process.
          </Text>

          <Text>
            The following seven supplements have robust clinical research demonstrating their ability to 
            increase testosterone levels through specific, measurable mechanisms. Each targets a different 
            pathway, making them highly effective when used individually or in combination.

            <strong>The Science:</strong> Clinical studies show KSM-66 ashwagandha can increase testosterone 
            levels by 14-40% in just 8 weeks. Participants also experienced improved muscle mass, strength,

            KSM-66 is the most researched form of ashwagandha with the highest concentration of active

            Fadogia Agrestis is particularly effective when combined with Tongkat Ali, as they work through 
            complementary pathways. While Tongkat Ali reduces SHBG to free up bound testosterone, Fadogia Agrestis 
            stimulates the production of new testosterone at the source.

            Traditional Nigerian medicine has used Fadogia Agrestis for male fertility and vitality. The stem extract

            <strong>The Science:</strong> Studies show that men with elevated prolactin have significantly

            This supplement offers a unique dual benefit. Not only does it support testosterone production 
            by removing prolactin inhibition, but the dopamine boost improves motivation, focus, and overall 
            drive. It's particularly valuable for men dealing with stress-related hormonal imbalances.

            Boron is incredibly cost-effective and one of the cheapest testosterone-optimizing 
            supplements with some of the fastest results. The key is getting the therapeutic 10mg dose,

            This mineral is particularly valuable for men over 35 when aromatase enzyme activity

            Always pair zinc with copper in a 10:1 or 15:1 ratio to prevent copper deficiency, which

            Consider baseline blood work if you suspect clinically low testosterone (below 300 ng/dL). 
            However, most men will experience significant quality of life improvements even if their 
            levels move from "low normal" to "optimal normal" ranges.

            Remember that supplements work best as part of a comprehensive approach including adequate 
            sleep (7-9 hours), regular strength training, stress management, and proper nutrition. 
            These supplements amplify the effects of a healthy lifestyle but don't replace it.
