            If you wake up not fully rested, Yoga Nidra can help you start your day efficiently. 
            This technique can assist you in achieving a sleep-like state and replenishing dopamine, 
            reducing cortisol, and decreasing total sleep need.

            "There are some interesting data published showing that these yoga nidra meditations, if you will, 
            can upregulate some of the neurotransmitters in the brain, including dopamine, that make you prepared for action."

            The practice involves guided body scans and visualizations that bring the mind and body 
            into a deep relaxation state akin to the state between wakefulness and sleep.

            <LinkComponent href="#">Omega-3 fish oil supplements</LinkComponent> are an essential part of a longevity and performance routine. 
            While fatty fish like salmon and sardines provide omega-3s, many people don't consume enough through diet alone.
          </Text>

          <Text>
            That's why it's highly recommended to supplement with fish oil or algae oil to ensure the body gets adequate 
            amounts of EPA and DHA, the key omega-3 fatty acids. Additionally, pairing omega-3 fish oil with DHEA in the 
            morning supports hormone balance and reduce inflammation.

            Creating a consistent evening routine helps signal to your body that it's time to prepare for sleep.

            <LinkComponent href="#">TMG (Trimethylglycine)</LinkComponent> is a key component in many longevity-focused supplement routines because of its central 
            role in methylation, a critical process for cellular repair, detoxification, and cardiovascular support.

            <LI>Plays a role in methylation: TMG acts as a methyl donor, providing the building blocks needed for the body to convert homocysteine into methionine</LI>
            <LI>Supports cognitive and neurological function: Methylation directly influences neurotransmitter production, brain energy metabolism, and mood regulation</LI>
            <LI>May benefit cardiovascular health: By helping reduce homocysteine levels, TMG contributes to the maintenance of healthy blood vessels and normal circulation</LI>
          </UL>

          <Text>
            TMG is a practical addition to any longevity supplement plan aiming to support cardiovascular health, cognitive 
            function, and optimal methylation. Its versatility and complementary role to other supplements make it a useful tool for 
            maintaining optimal wellness from within through a data-driven approach.
